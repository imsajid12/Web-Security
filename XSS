The third and final type of XSS is another Non-Persistent type called DOM-based XSS . While reflected XSS sends the input data to the back-end server through HTTP requests, DOM XSS is completely processed on the client-side through JavaScript. 
DOM XSS occurs when JavaScript is used to change the page source through the Document Object Model (DOM) .

Source & Sink
To further understand the nature of the DOM-based XSS vulnerability, we must understand
the concept of the Source and Sink of the object displayed on the page. The Source is
the JavaScript object that takes the user input, and it can be any input parameter like a URL
parameter or an input field, as we saw above.
On the other hand, the Sink is the function that writes the user input to a DOM Object on
the page. If the Sink function does not properly sanitize the user input, it would be
vulnerable to an XSS attack. Some of the commonly used JavaScript functions to write to
DOM objects are:
document.write()
DOM.innerHTML
DOM.outerHTML
Furthermore, some of the jQuery library functions that write to DOM objects are:
add()
after()
append()
If a Sink function writes the exact input without any sanitization (like the above functions),
and no other means of sanitization were used, then we know that the page should be
vulnerable to XSS.
